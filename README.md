JustInTime
Time & Shift Management - Designed for Users

This GitHub project is my Final Year Project (FYP) for my university degree, where I created a time and shift management appliction for companies, designed with the end user in mind.

While working multipe jobs at university I noticed that they all seemed to use different management applictions for their part-time workers, with none of them really being designed for ease of use center of mind. The application I designed set out to solve this problem by approaching it from a user first perspective.

The application itself follows a package design where each feature is self contained and then linked to others through pre-defined interfaces allowing for tight control around infomation sharing. This was my first time using such an approach and so is a little clunky.

JustInTime application is fully functional as long as a FireStore database is defined when the application is complied and there is a Firebase Authentication server available. As the application had to be built under very tight timeline requirements Firebase was used to help speed up the process.
